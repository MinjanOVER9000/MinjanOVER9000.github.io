								<h2>The History and the Orign of the legendary game......<br />
								Chess</h2>
								<p>The most commonly held belief is that chess originated in India, where it was called Chaturanga, which appears to have been invented in the 6th century AD.<br /> Although this is commonly believed, it is thought that Persians created a more modern version of the game after the Indians.</p>

								<h2>The Material chess</h2>
								<p>You might be like, OK. I got this, so I have to go and checkmate the other king. Well, the problem is that you need to get past 15 different pieces. The solution is material chess. This is when one plays and trys to get chess pieces off the opponent so the enemy is easier to checkmate. The queen is worth 9 points, rook 5, knight and bishop 3, and the pawns are worth one. The King is worth the game. </p>

								<h2>How to move in Chess</h2>
								<p>So in order for the game of chess to progress, the player has to move their pieces.<br />
								Here I will be telling you how to move each piece in the game. and a good thing to remember. White always moves first.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>The King</h3>
									<p>The King is the most valuable piece in the game, and also one of the most limited. It can only move one space in any direction for one turn.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>The Queen</h3>
									<p>The Queen is the most powerful piece in the game. If you lose your queen, then one would probably lose the game. The queen can move in any direction infinitly. Cannot jump over pieces. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>The Rook</h3>
									<p>The Rook is a important piece in the game that is usually brought out in the end game. The Rook can move infinitly in and vertical or horizontal line that it is in. Also cannot jump over pieces</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>The Knight</h3>
									<p>The knight is a rather special pieces and is used in a very tactical way. This is because the knight can jump over enemy pieces and allie pieces. The knight moves in a "L" shaped position</p>
									<img height="150"src = "http://www.family-games-treasurehouse.com/images/Chess_Moves_Knight.gif">
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>The Bishop</h3>
									<p>The Bishop is somewhat like the rook but instead of moving horizonatally and vertically, it can only move diagonnaly, it is also a tactical piece in the game.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>The Pawn</h3>
									<p>The pawn is a weak piece on the board, however, to compensate for the weakness of the pawn, they decided to add the concept of promotion, which is if a pawn reaches the end of the board, than the pawn can turn into another piece of choice. The pawn can move one space forward and two if the pawn has not moved yet. To capture another piece, a pawn has to be one square diagonal from the other piece</p>
